<h3>Online Trainable Image Recognition Platform</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is my Intern project at AiTmed, a Telemedical startup head to Anaheim.</p>
<h3>High-Resolution Human Image generation</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This project aimed to design a high-resolution image generation model that could generate high-resolution human images in fast speed (goal: 30-40fps)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Check project Github&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bill9800/Human-FSRCNN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Check video presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQt-ds5p8Ho&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p>
<h3>Human Facial Emotion Recognition</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In this project, a human emotion recognition system was built by deep learning. (VGG-16 convolution neural network model) Model was trained by 12,993 images of human faces with eight basic emotions. (anger, fear, happiness, disgust, neutral, surprise, contempt, sadness)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In this project, I finished the following works:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Preprocessed and balanced data: upload image data and transfer into a data matrix, flip image upside down and make right/left rotate to expand training set. Separated data in different groups to overcome data imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Built deep learning model used Keras with Tensorflow framework: Built a VGG-16 ConvNet, trained in AWS E2 and saved parameters</p>

<h3>Movie Revenue Prediction and Related Recommend System</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In this project, a regression system was built to predict movie revenue from TMBD 5,000 movies dataset. Several related movies in the dataset were listed for a given new movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In this project, I finished the following works:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Applied PCA to extract important feature, applied semi-supervised 1NN to fill missing data.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.Trained supervised machine learning models by random forest, output the DNN model as the best prediction model with an average error of less than 15%.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Applied KNN to find the first n nearest movie as the recommended relatively movie.</p>
<h3>Online News Popularity Prediction</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a course final project, me and my partner in charged of a&nbsp; News Popularity prediction model</p>

<h3>CopyCat App Detection</h3>
<p>This project aimed to detect all copycat Apps in Google Play App store.</p>
<p>I extracted more than 40,000 Apps information include App description and resealse data and version, download, priceï¼Œ etc. 
  from Google play, and vectorize each App's description based on bag of words model, applies TF/IDF and PCA to reduce demension (reduce
   90%), and clustering the final phrase vector by cosine similarity.</p>
 <p> Though this method is simple, the final result is good. Take CANDY CRUSH as an example, In the first 80 similar Apps of CANDY CRUSH,
  there are 58 Apps are copycat or has similar functions.</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<h3>Spoken Language Detection</h3>
<p>This project aimed to detect language spoken in the audio record.</p>
<p>In this priject, I had 60 audio records (10 min for each) which contains reading in English, Mandarin and Hindi. My job is training a deep learning 
  model to recognize spoken language based on this 60 audio data. I implemented my model by the following step:</p>
 <p> %nbsp; %nbsp; 1. I segmentate each audio record into small blocks which contain 10 seconds of language spoken audio. This expand my
  dataset into 3,000 audio data</p>
  <p> %nbsp; %nbsp; 2. I used Python pakage <a href="https://librosa.github.io/librosa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibROSA</a> to extract fetures 
    from audio. This pakage help me extract 64 features for each second using 
    <a herf="https://librosa.github.io/librosa/generated/librosa.feature.mfcc.html" rel="noopener">Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)</a> </p>
  <p> %nbsp; %nbsp; 3. Build Recurrent Nerual Network(RNN) model with 2 LSTM layers. There model obtained an accuracy of 73.5%</p>
