<p> I am interested
in building fundamental connections between the techniques used in the control and machine learning
communities.   Specifically, my current research focuses on developing new analysis/design/validation tools that ensure an efficient and safe integration of control
and learning techniques for next generation intelligent systems such as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, and smart buildings. </p>

<h2>Control System & Robotics</h2>
<h3>Deformable Snake-Quadruped Robot</h3>
<p>Deep learning techniques have been used to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for a variety of applications (computer vision, natural language processing, and Go). 

 </p>

<h3>Wireless Intragastric Capsule</h3>
<p>Deep learning techniques have been used to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for a variety of applications (computer vision, natural language processing, and Go). 

 </p>
 
<h3>Wind Pendulum Control System</h3> 
<p>Deep learning techniques have been used to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for a variety of applications (computer vision, natural language processing, and Go). 

 </p>

<h2>Networks & Sensor Networks</h2>
<p>I am interested in reconciling robust control with deep reinforcement learning for safety-critical AI applications. I
d systems with deep neural nets in the loop.  </p>



<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p> Optimization can be viewed as a control problem. By viewing the gradient of the cost function
as a plant one wants to control, the optimization problem becomes an output regulation control problem.
Consequently, first-order optimization methods can be viewed as controllers regulating the plant. For example, gradient descent,
Nesterov’s method, and heavy-ball method can all be viewed as special cases of the proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controllers. My current research focus is on translating “controllers” into “optimization
methods” for large-scale unconstrained and constrained optimization problems in machine learning, control, robotics, smart buildings, and power systems.</p>
