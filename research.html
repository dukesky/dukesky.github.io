<p> In undergraduate study, I did several research project on system design and control, include robotic and different sensor networks.
    In graduate study, I learned machine learning and did research on optimization and networks. During my study, I find that applying machine learning methods (in prediction or design controller)
  can make great improvement on system robust and accuracy. I wish to continue researching on applying machine learning method to build Intelligent
  System for my Ph.D. study.

<h2>Networks & Sensor Networks</h2>
<p>I am interested in reconciling robust control with deep reinforcement learning for safety-critical AI applications. I
d systems with deep neural nets in the loop.  </p>



<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p> Optimization can be viewed as a control problem. By viewing the gradient of the cost function
as a plant one wants to control, the optimization problem becomes an output regulation control problem.
Consequently, first-order optimization methods can be viewed as controllers regulating the plant. For example, gradient descent,
Nesterov’s method, and heavy-ball method can all be viewed as special cases of the proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controllers. My current research focus is on translating “controllers” into “optimization
methods” for large-scale unconstrained and constrained optimization problems in machine learning, control, robotics, smart buildings, and power systems.</p>
