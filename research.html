<h1>Research <br /></h1>
</div>



<p>  &nbsp &nbsp In undergraduate study, I did several research projects about system design and control, robotic and sensor networks.
  I learned how to build a rubust system to finish specific task with the help of actuators and sensors.</p>
<p>  &nbsp &nbsp In graduate study, I learned machine learning and how to applied these knowledge into prediction and signal processing.
  I also did research on optimization and networks.</p>
<p>  &nbsp &nbsp My graduate study experience inspired me to apply machine learning methods into designing controllier and builting
  rubust system. I wish to continue researching on applying machine learning method to build Intelligent System for my Ph.D. study.

<h2>Control System & Robotics</h2>
  <h3>Deformable Snake-Quadruped Robot</h3>
  <img src="figs/snake_1.jpg" width="450px" height="300px" /> 
  <p> &nbsp &nbsp In this project, we aimed to built a robot, which can be used in searching rescue after diseaster such as earchquake.
    The robot has the ability of working in difference terrains such as narrow space under ruins and complexity conditions on the 
    top of ruins. In order to achieve these purpose, the robot has two work forms:  </p>
    <p> &nbsp &nbsp 1.snake form: make it easier to work in narrow area such as tunnel or under ruins</p>
    <p> &nbsp &nbsp 2.quad&nbsp ruped form: working in complex terrains, with obstacle such as rocks and steps</p>
  <p>  &nbsp &nbsp We designed a new robot that combine the advantage of both snake robot and quardpeded robot, it will change its form 
    automatically based on the environment. Our robot was built based on the conception of modular robot. Each snake chains was a 
    simple robot where two chains works as a snake or quardpaeded shape. It's also possilbe that more than two snake chains(4 or 6) 
    connect and work together to finish rescue task. To control the robot, we used centralized control method, the master
    chain control the whole network. Sensors such as ultrasonic and camera are also attached to help rescue. </p>

  <h3>Wireless Intragastric Capsule</h3>
   <img src="figs/capsule2.jpg" width="450px" height="300px" /> 
  <p>  &nbsp &nbsp In this project, we aimed to design an edible intragastric capsule to help users lose weight based on the technology of 
    intragastric balloons. Generally speaking, patient swallow this tiny robot. When it goes down to patent's stomach, it begins to 
    work. The capsule robot will expand to 3-4 times of it's origional size by wireless control. Because it stays in patents
    stomach with a big size, the patient feels full and don't want to eat, which helps them to loss weight. At the end of treatment,
    the robot reduces to its original size, and can be expeled through normal excretion.

  <h3>Wind Pendulum Control System</h3> 
  <img src="figs/pendulum3.jpg" width="450px" height="300px" /> 
  <p> &nbsp &nbsp Wind pendulum is a three dimension(3D) pendulum that at the end of pendulum there is a platform attached four fans facing four 
    different directions. When pendulum is swinging, it's swing speed and angle was controlled by generating wind from four fans. 
    This system is an nonlinear system with high latency because first, fans itselve is an nonlinear system, it's hard to build model 
    of force generated by fans rotation and second, it's 
    We analysis the wind pendulum system and built the danamic model, applied PID and PID with Kalman Filter as the control methods to
    control the pendulum system. We finished both simulation in Matlab and built test-bed to apply control methods on it.

<h2>Networks & Sensor Networks</h2>
  <h3>Ultrasonic Wave Blind Guide Glove</h3> 
   <img src="figs/glove2.jpg" width="350px" height="350px" /> 
  <p> &nbsp &nbsp In this project, we designed an accessory aiming to guide blind people, help them avoid dager such as moving vhecle or 
    front obstacle. The accessory was embedded in a glove, it has the functions of:
     <p> &nbsp &nbsp 1.detect distance between user and obstacle of three direction (front, left front, right front), and calculate speed if
  the obstacle is moving. Give user feedback of distance or speed.</p>
    <p> &nbsp &nbsp 2.prediction if the user will encounter dager in the next 5 seconds.</p> 
  &nbsp &nbsp To achieve these goals, our blind glove was besigned

<h2>Optimization</h2>
  <h3>Priced Based Priority Queue</h3> 
<p>This project aimed to look for a optimal priority arrangement of information transfer in the internet.

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<h3>Cat vs. Dog Species Recognition</h3> 
 <img src="figs/dogcat2.jpg" width="450px" height="300px" /> 
 <p> In this project, I used Kaggle dataset of 15,000 dogs and 15,000 cat images to training a deeping learning model to indentify if a
  picture is a dog or cat(By the restriction of computering power in PC, only used 3,000 picutres as training set). By using VGG ConvNet,
   I built a 16 layers deep neural network, outcome a accuracy of 79% and loss of 0.55 in test set.</p>
