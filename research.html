<h1>Research <br /></h1>
</div>



<p> In undergraduate study, I did several research project on system design and control, include robotic and different sensor networks.</p>
<p> In graduate study, I learned machine learning and did research on optimization and networks.</p>
<p> During my study, I find that applying machine learning methods (in prediction or design controller)
  can make great improvement on system robust and accuracy. I wish to continue researching on applying machine learning method to build Intelligent
  System for my Ph.D. study.

<h2>Control System & Robotics</h2>
  <h3>Deformable Snake-Quadruped Robot</h3>
  <img src="figs/snake_1.jpg" width="450px" height="300px" /> 
  <p>In this project, we aimed to built a multi-terrain resecure reobot, which can be used in resucure after diseaster such as earchquake. The robot has two
    work form:  </p>
    <p> 1.snake form: working in narrow area such as tunnel or under ruins</p>
    <p> 2.quadruped form: working in complex terrains, with obstacle such as rocks and steps</p>
  <p>We designed a way to make </p>

  <h3>Wireless Intragastric Capsule</h3>

  <p>In this project, we aimed to design an edible intragastric capsule to help users lose weight based on the technology of intragastric balloons.
    patient SWALLOW this tiny robot to it stomach, where the capsule robot begin to work. It expand to 3-4 times of it's origional size, which makes 
    the patient feels full and don't want to eat anymore.
  </p>

  <h3>Wind Pendulum Control System</h3> 
  <p>We analysis the wind pendulum system and built the danamic model, applied PID and PID with Kalman Filter as the control method to control the 
    pendulum system. We finished both simulation in Matlab and real-world test.
