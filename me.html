      <p>&nbsp &nbsp Working out is probably the second important thing I do everyday! (of course the first is research :) )
        I go to gyms 4-5 times every week and continued for one and a half years. Working out helps me getting up 
        early everyday and energetic while doing everything. My body was reshaped according to working out, I reduced
        my weight from 185lb to 145lb. </p>
      <p> &nbsp &nbsp I like travelling, I like road trip, I like hiking on weekend or holiday. I alway feel a strong connection between
  me and the nature. </p>
      <p> &nbsp &nbsp  I like many sports games. Pool balls(snooker) is my favourite sports, I feel calm and passonate when I play snooker. I also
        play soccer, basketball, volleyball, table tennis and swimming, running. </p>
      <p> &nbsp &nbsp  I like watching moive</p>
      <p> &nbsp &nbsp  I like visiting galleries and meseums.</p>
