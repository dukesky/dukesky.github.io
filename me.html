              Work out is probably the second important thing I do everyday! (of course the first is study/research :) )
              Go to gyms 4-5 times every week is one step of work out. Besides, control of what to eat everyday is another indespensible step!
              It may be tough in the beginning, but after keeping a few month, I find great benefit! I became getting up early everyday and energetic to
              while doing everything!
              I was 185lbs two years ago, I reduced to 150lbs in 5 months, and then I began bulking. My object is 170lb with 10%-12% body fat rate!
