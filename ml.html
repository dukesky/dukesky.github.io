<h1>Research <br /></h1>

<p>  &nbsp &nbsp My graduate study experience inspired me to apply machine learning methods into designing controller and building
  robust system. I wish to continue researching on applying machine learning method to build an Intelligent System for my Ph.D. study.

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

<h3> Human Facial Emotion Recognition</h3>
   <img src="figs/emotions.jpg" width="500px" height="300px" /> 
  <p>&nbsp &nbsp In this project, a human emotion recognition system was built by deep learining. (VGG-16 convolution neural network
    model) Model was trained by 12,993 mage of human faces with eight basic emotions.
    (anger, fear, happiness, disgust, neutral, surprise, contempt, sadness) </p>
   <p>&nbsp &nbsp In this project, I finished the following works: </p>
   <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1. Preprocessed and balanced data: upload image data and transfer into data matrix, flip image upside down and
  make right/left rotate to expanse tranining set. Seperated data in different groups to overcome data imbalance.</p>
   <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2. Built deep learning model used Keras with Tensorflow framework: Built a VGG-16 Convnet, trained the
     and saved parameters</p>
  
 <h3>Cat vs. Dog Species Recognition</h3> 
 <img src="figs/dogcat2.jpg" width="450px" height="300px" /> 
 <p> &nbsp &nbsp In this project, I used Kaggle dataset of 15,000 dogs and 15,000 cat images to training a deeping learning model to 
   indentify if a picture is a dog or cat(By the restriction of computering power in PC, only used 3,000 picutres as training set). 
   By using VGG ConvNet, I built a 16 layers deep neural network, outcome a accuracy of 79% and loss of 0.55 in test set.</p>
 
<h3> Moive Revenue Prediction and Related Recommend System</h3>
  <img src="figs/movie1.jpg" width="450px" height="300px" /> 
<p> &nbsp &nbsp In this project, a regression system was built to predict movie revenue from TMBD 5,000 movies dataset. Several
  related movie in the dataset was listed for a given new moive.
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp In this project, I finished the following works: </p>
   <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1.Applied PCA to extract important feature, applied semi-supervised 1NN to fill missing data.
 </p>
   <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2.Trained supervised machine learning models by random forest,
     output the DNN model as the best prediction model with an average error less than 15%.  </p> 
   <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3.	Applied KNN to find the first n nearest movie as the recommended relatively movie.  </p>
